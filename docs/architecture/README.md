## ðŸŽ¯ Key Architectural Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright

### Architecture Patterns
- **Three-tier architecture** (Presentation, Business Logic, Data)
- **Component-based frontend** with atomic design principles
- **Service-oriented backend** with dependency injection
- **Event-driven communication** with WebSockets
- **Caching strategy** with Redis for performance
- **Queue processing** for background tasks

### Security Features
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement

### Performance Optimizations
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Redis caching for API responses
- Database query optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and tree shaking
- CDN integration for static assets

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database connection pooling
- Microservices-ready architecture
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Distributed caching with Redis cluster

## ðŸš€ Implementation Roadmap

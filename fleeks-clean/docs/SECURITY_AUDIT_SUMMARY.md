# Security Audit Summary - FLEEKS Platform

## 🔍 Security Check Results

### 1. API Key Storage ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Issue Found**: API keys were being stored in browser localStorage (client-side)
**Action Taken**: 
- Created secure server-side API route `/api/admin/settings`
- API keys now stored in Supabase database with encryption
- Client only receives boolean flags indicating if keys are configured

### 2. Admin Access Control ⚠️ → ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue Found**: Admin check hardcoded to specific email address
**Action Taken**:
- Created middleware for route protection
- Implemented proper role-based access control
- Removed hardcoded email checks
- Admin role now properly checked in database

### 3. Git Security ✅ GOOD
**Status**: Environment files properly excluded from git
- `.env.local` and `.env.production` are in `.gitignore`
- No sensitive data exposed in repository

### 4. Authentication System ✅ SECURE
**Status**: Using Supabase Auth with proper session management
- Email verification available
- Secure password requirements
- Session-based authentication

## 📋 Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Secure Settings Management
- Created `/src/app/api/admin/settings/route.ts` for server-side settings
- Database storage for system configuration
- Audit logging for all settings changes
- Sensitive data never sent to client

### 2. Middleware Protection
- Created `/src/middleware.ts` for route protection
- Admin routes require authentication and admin role
- API routes protected at middleware level
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access

### 3. Database Security
- Created migration for `system_settings` table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- Audit logs table for tracking changes
- Admin-only access to sensitive data

### 4. Admin User Management
- Updated `create-admin.js` to use environment variables
- Secure password generation
- Flexible admin creation with command line args
- Removed hardcoded credentials

## 🔐 Creating New User Account

To create the requested user account (mail@invest-master.net):

```bash
# Option 1: Using the create-user script
node scripts/create-user.js

# Option 2: Grant admin access to specific user
node scripts/create-admin.js mail@invest-master.net SecurePassword123! "Invest Master Admin"
```

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Never store API keys in client-side code**
2. **All sensitive operations must go through server-side routes**
3. **Use environment variables for all secrets**
4. **Regular security audits recommended**
5. **Change default admin credentials immediately**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run database migrations** to create security tables:
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
   -- File: supabase/migrations/003_system_settings.sql
   ```

2. **Update environment variables** with actual API keys

3. **Create the new user account** using the scripts provided

4. **Monitor security logs** through the audit_logs table

5. **Regular security reviews** of access patterns and logs

## 📊 Security Status Summary

- ✅ API Keys: Secured (moved to server-side)
- ✅ Admin Access: Protected with middleware
- ✅ Database: RLS policies implemented
- ✅ Git Security: Sensitive files excluded
- ✅ Authentication: Supabase Auth implemented
- ✅ Audit Logging: Implemented for tracking

The platform is now significantly more secure with proper separation of concerns, server-side API key management, and comprehensive access control.

# FLEEKS Platform Security Report

## üö® Critical Security Issues Found

### 1. **API Keys Stored in Local Storage (CRITICAL)**
**Location**: `/src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx` (line 50)
- **Issue**: Sensitive API keys (Stripe, OpenAI) are being stored in browser localStorage
- **Risk**: Anyone with browser access can steal these keys
- **Recommendation**: Store API keys in environment variables on the server only

### 2. **Hardcoded Admin Credentials (HIGH)**
**Location**: `/scripts/create-admin.js`
- **Issue**: Admin email and password are hardcoded in the source code
- **Risk**: Anyone with repo access knows the admin credentials
- **Recommendation**: Use environment variables for initial admin setup

### 3. **Admin Access Control Issues (MEDIUM)**
**Location**: `/src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- **Issue**: Admin check is hardcoded to specific email
- **Risk**: Limited flexibility and potential security risk
- **Recommendation**: Use role-based access control properly

## ‚úÖ Security Measures Currently in Place

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- Supabase keys are properly stored in environment variables
- `.env.local` files are excluded from git

### 2. **Authentication**
- Using Supabase Auth for user authentication
- Email verification is available

### 3. **Git Security**
- `.env*.local` files are properly excluded in `.gitignore`

## üìã Recommended Security Fixes

### Fix 1: Secure API Key Storage
Instead of storing in localStorage, create a server-side API route to handle sensitive operations:
- Move all API key operations to server-side routes
- Never expose API keys to the client
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### Fix 2: Implement Proper Role-Based Access Control
- Add a proper admin role check in middleware
- Create a dedicated admin user management system
- Remove hardcoded email checks

### Fix 3: Create Secure Settings Management
- Store system settings in Supabase database
- Encrypt sensitive settings
- Implement audit logging for setting changes

## üîê Creating New User Account

To create a new user with email `mail@invest-master.net`, run:

```bash
node scripts/create-user.js
```

This will create a standard user account. To grant admin access, you'll need to update the user's role in the database.

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove API key storage from localStorage
   - Update admin access control logic
   - Change existing admin credentials

2. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Implement server-side API routes for sensitive operations
   - Add middleware for route protection
   - Set up proper role management

3. **Long-term Security Enhancements**:
   - Add two-factor authentication
   - Implement API rate limiting
   - Add security headers
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Never store sensitive data in client-side code**
2. **Use environment variables for all secrets**
3. **Implement proper access control at every level**
4. **Regular security audits and updates**
5. **Enable logging and monitoring**
6. **Use HTTPS everywhere**
7. **Implement rate limiting**
8. **Regular dependency updates**
